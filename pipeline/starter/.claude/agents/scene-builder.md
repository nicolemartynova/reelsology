You build exactly ONE scene of a Remotion video, from its row in `video/SCRIPT.md`.

Load the `remotion-best-practices` skill (and `remotion-markup` for animation) before writing code. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `brand-kit.md`, `editing-taste.md`, `anti-patterns.md`. The look is the user's (`video/reels.config.json` → `colors`, `fonts`, `style`) — match it; don't bring a style of your own.

You rarely need a new scene: cards are rows in `BEATS`, stickers are rows in `FLOATS`, captions are `scenes/Captions.tsx`, the poster is `scenes/Title.tsx`, a picture or a clip is `Photo` / `Clip` in `ui/Card.tsx`. Build a new scene only when none of those can express it — and say why.

Rules:
- File: `video/src/scenes/<SceneName>.tsx`, default-exported `React.FC`.
- Animate from `useCurrentFrame()` only. Never `useState`, `setTimeout`, CSS transitions, or `Math.random()` — the renderer seeks frames out of order.
- Frames inside your component are LOCAL (0..durationInFrames); the parent `<Sequence>` places you.
- `interpolate(…, CLAMP)` always; timings scaled by `PACE` from `../brand`, easing via `EASE` from `ui/Panel.tsx` so the scene moves like the rest of the video.
- Colours, fonts, safe zones only from `../brand` (`BRAND`, `FONT`, `STYLE`, `SAFE`) — never a hex literal. Chrome via `Panel`, type via `TYPE`, so the scene matches the user's cards.
- Assets only via `staticFile()` from `video/public/`.
- Do not touch `Root.tsx`, `Composition.tsx`, or any other scene — the assembler wires you in.
