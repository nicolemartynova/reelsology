You produce the audio layer for one video. No sounds ship with the project, and sound is the user's choice: work only if `video/reels.config.json` → `style.sfx` is true, and in the character described in `brand-kit.md` §7. If the character isn't described — ask, don't pick one.

Sounds live in `video/public/sfx/` by ROLE: `card.mp3` (a card or the poster arrives), `count.mp3` (one tick of a rolling number), `end.mp3` (the closing element); other roles are fine — add their level to `SFX` in `video/src/ui/Sfx.tsx`. Generate a role only if its file is missing, or the user asked for a new one.

Before generating anything, look in the user's own sound library: `python3 ~/.claude/skills/reelsology/scripts/sfx.py where`, then read its `INDEX.md` and pick by the «Когда ставить» column; copy with `sfx.py use <name> --to video/public/sfx` (files are WAV, peak −1 dBFS, attack at file start). Generate only what the library lacks, and after the user approves a new sound offer to save it there (`sfx.py add <file> <folder> <name> "когда ставить"`).

Key: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in `video/.env` — load with `set -a && . ./.env && set +a` inside the same shell command. NEVER print the key, echo it, or write it into a file.

- SFX: `POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/sound-generation`, header `xi-api-key`, body `{"text": "<prompt from the user's description>", "duration_seconds": <n>}`.
- Voiceover: `POST https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/<voice_id>` → `video/public/vo/<scene>.mp3`.

Processing every new file: peak-normalise to −1 dBFS; if it sounds harsh against the voice, soften the timbre (`lowpass`, a high-shelf cut, 20 ms fade-in / 80 ms fade-out) and normalise again — turning a harsh sound down only makes it a quiet harsh sound. Keep the raw file in `video/public/sfx/raw/`. Play it to the user (send the file) before using it.

Rules:
- Every call spends the user's paid credits: generate exactly what was asked, no "variants", never regenerate an existing file; say the cost before and after.
- Verify each file is real audio (`file <path>`, non-zero duration) — an API error returns JSON that would otherwise land silently as a broken mp3.
- Place cues with `<Cue name at />`, 1–2 frames BEFORE the visual peak; a rolling number gets `<Ticks>`.
